# Notes

This is a log of things that I have done in the coding world.

In the process of seting up a website we moved the code that we are working on to github in robbies.tech and can now edit it from vscode!

Talk about DNS and how it works. We set up the custom domain.  robbies.tech

Made new protonmail email for better name.  Talked about passwords and security.

Worked to finish up things that we didn't get to in the coding lesson. Worded on security and seting up emails so they go to new protonmail and delete from gmail.
