              <h2>School</h2>
              <p>The learning platform known as school is part of my life. (A very nice way of saying that I go to school) I decided that it should take a spot on this page because of its big role in many lives. Personally I think school is to restricted and should be more open to learning through ones intrests and through th art of exploring and discovering. As well as sharing ideas instead of declaring them.</p>
