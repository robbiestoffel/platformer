          <h2>Keeper Of The Lost Cities</h2>
          <p>
            This is my favorite book series as of right now. (Big shout out to Shannon Messenger!) My favorite character is Fitz even though all of my friends like Keefe better! (Fitz is awsome!) and Tam should get to be in the Foster Fan Club! Lodstar is my favorite book in the series, DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT READ LODESTAR and I think of it as the rise of the Neverseen (which makes it thrilling) it is also good because it gives Fitz points over Keefe (I mean, everyone knows that you shouldn't run of with the enemy!!!)

          <h2>Harry Potter</h2>
          <p>
            This series is so famous and so good to! I will never forget the greatness of this story! It is perfect! With all of the right cliff hangers and the dreaded enemys makes this book awsome! AArrrY Po-err!
